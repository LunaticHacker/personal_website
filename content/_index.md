Hi I'm Luna. I spend most of my time writing code or studying topics from CS, Maths and Marxist Theory

If you are looking for my coding projects take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/LunaticHacker)
else there isn't much here other than these [scribblings](/poems)

You can stalk me at [lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/u/lunatichacker) or [lemmygrad](https://lemmygrad.ml/u/lunatichacker)

If you want to get in touch with me steal my email from my gitlogs or ping me on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@lunatichacker:matrix.org)(responses will be slow)
